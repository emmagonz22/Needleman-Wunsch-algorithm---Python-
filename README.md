# Needleman-Wunsch-algorithm-Python



>Requirements: 
The Goal of project one is to implement your own Needleman-Wunsch algorithm using Dynamic Programming.
    As a scoring matrix, the algorithm must use the following:
        Reward on a match: 1
        Penalty on a mismatch: -1
        Gap penalty: -2
The application must be developed in Python
The application will take as an input file from the command line and will output the sequences alignments for each of the rows on the input file.
The input file will be a comma separated (csv) file with the following format



## Use of csv library to process the data of the cvs file
